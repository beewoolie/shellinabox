.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B shellinaboxd
daemon implements a webserver that listens on the specified
.IR port .
The web server publishes one or more
.I services
that will be displayed in a VT100 emulator implemented as an AJAX web
application. By default, the port is 4200 and the default service URL is
.IR http://localhost:4200/ .
.P
If no particular
.I service
was requested, the server launches
.B /bin/login
querying the user for their username and password. It then starts the
user's default login shell.
.P
Any modern JavaScript and CSS enabled browser will be able to access the
published
.I service
without requiring additional plugins.
.SH OPTIONS
The following command line parameters control the operation of the daemon:
.TP \w'\-b\ |\ 'u
\fB-b\fP\ | \fB--background\fP[\fB=\fP\fIpidfile\fP]
Launch
.B shellinaboxd
as a background daemon process. Optionally, write the process id to
.IR pidfile .
.TP
\fB-c\fP\ |\ \fB--cert\fP\ \fIcertdir\fP
If built with SSL/TLS support enabled, the daemon will look in
.I certdir
for any certificates. If unspecified, this defaults to the current
working directory.

If the browser negotiated a
.B Server Name Identification
the daemon will look for a matching
.I certificate-\f[BI]SERVERNAME\fP.pem
file. This allows for virtual hosting of multiple server names on the
same IP address and port.

If no
.B SNI
handshake took place, it falls back on using the certificate in the
.I certificate.pem
file.

The administrator should make sure that there are matching
certificates for each of the virtual hosts on this server, and that
there is a generic
.I certificate.pem
file.

If no suitable certificate is installed,
.B shellinaboxd
will attempt to invoke
.B /usr/bin/openssl
and create a new self-signed certificate. This only succeeds if, after
dropping privileges,
.B shell\%ina\%boxd
has write permissions for
.IR certdir .

Most browsers show a warning message when encountering a self-signed
certificate and then allow the user the option of accepting the
certificate. Due to this usability problem, and due to the perceived
security implications, the use of auto-generated self-signed
certificates is intended for testing or in intranet deployments, only.
.TP
\fB-d\fP\ |\ \fB--debug\fP
enables debugging mode, resulting in lots of log messages on
.IR stderr .
This option is mutually exclusive with
.B --quiet
and
.BR --verbose .
.TP
\fB-f\fP\ |\ \fB--static-file=\fP\fIurl\fP:\fIfile\fP
The daemon serves various built-in resources from URLs underneath the
.I service
mount points. One or more
.B --static-file
options allow for overriding these resources with customized externally
provided
.IR files .
The
.I url
can either be an absolute or a relative path. In the former case, it overrides
exactly one built-in resource for one specific
.IR service ,
whereas in the latter case it overrides resources for each defined
.IR service .

The following resources are available for customization:
.RS
.TP \w'ShellInABox.js\ \ \ 'u
.B beep.wav
audio sample that gets played whenever the terminal BEL is sounded.
.TP
.B favicon.ico
favicon image file that is displayed in the browser's navigation bar.
.TP
.B ShellInABox.js
JavaScript file implementing the AJAX terminal emulator.
.TP
.B styles.css
CSS style file that controls the visual appearance of the terminal.
.P
It is not recommended to override the root HTML page for a particular
.IR service .
Instead, move the service to an anonymous URL and serve a
.I static-file
that references the
.I service
in an
.IR <iframe> .

Instead of a
.IR file ,
it is possible to provide the name of a directory. This turns
.B shellinaboxd
into a simple web server that publishes all of the files in that
particular directory. This option can be helpful when publishing a more
complex root HTML page.
.RE
.TP
\fB-g\fP\ |\ \fB--group=\fP\fIgid\fP
When started as
.BR root ,
the server drops most privileges at start up. Unless overridden by the
.B --group
option, it switches to
.BR nogroup .

When already running as an unprivileged user, the group remains
unchanged, unless a change was explicitly requested with the
.B --group
option. On most UNIX systems, the latter is only possible, if the
binary has been made
.BR setuid-root .
This is a non-standard configuration.

If running with SSL/TLS support enabled, the certificates must be
accessible to the unprivileged user and/or group that the daemon
runs as.
.TP
\fB-h\fP\ |\ \fB--help\fP
Display a brief usage message showing the valid command line parameters.
.TP
\fB-n\fP\ |\ \fB--numeric\fP
When running in
.B --verbose
mode, the daemon prints an
.IR Apache -style
log file to
.IR stderr .
By default, host names of peers get resolved
before logging them. As DNS look-ups can be expensive, it is possible
to request logging of numeric IP addresses, instead.
.TP
\fB-p\fP\ |\ \fB--port=\fP\fIport\fP
Unless overridden by this option, the web server listens on port 4200
for incoming HTTP and HTTPS requests.

.B shellinaboxd
can distinguish between SSL/TLS requests and unencrypted requests. It
also knows how to negotiate
.B Server Name
.BR Identification ,
allowing the use of a single port for all types of requests even when
virtual hosting.
.TP
\fB-s\fP\ |\ \fB--service=\fP\fIservice\fP
One or more services can be registered on different URL paths:
.in +4
\fISERVICE\fP := <url-path> ':' \fIAPPLICATON\fP
.in
There is one pre-defined \fIapplication\fP, 'LOGIN'. It causes the
daemon to invoke
.B /bin/login
to request the user's name and password, and to start his
login shell. This is the default option, if no
.B --service
was defined. Starting
.B /bin/login
requires
.B root
privileges.

Alternatively, an \fIapplication\fP can be specified by providing a
\fIuser\fP description, a working directory, and a command line:
.in +4
\fIAPPLICATION\fP := 'LOGIN' | \fIUSER\fP ':' \fICWD\fP ':' <cmdline>
.in

The keyword 'AUTH' indicates that the \fIuser\fP information should
be requested interactively, instead of being provided as part of the
\fIservice\fP description:
.in +4
\fIUSER\fP := 'AUTH' | <username> ':' <groupname>
.in

The working directory can either be given as an absolute path, or it
can be the user's home directory:
.in +4
\fICWD\fP := 'HOME' : <dir>
.in

The <cmdline> supports expansion of variables of the form ${VAR}.
Supported variables are:
.RS
.TP \w'${columns}\ \ 'u
.B ${columns}
number of columns.
.TP
.B ${gid}
numeric group id.
.TP
.B ${group}
group name.
.TP
.B ${home}
home directory.
.TP
.B ${lines}
number of rows.
.TP
.B ${peer}
name of remote peer.
.TP
.B ${uid}
numeric user id.
.TP
.B ${user}
user name.
.P
Other than the default environment variables of
.BR $TERM ,
.B $COLUMNS
and
.BR $LINES ,
services can have environment variables passed to them, by preceding
the <cmdline> with space separated variable assignments of the form
.IR KEY = VALUE .

The <cmdline> supports single and double quotes, as well as
backslashes for escaping characters in the familiar fashion.

Please note that when invoking
.B shellinaboxd
from a command line shell, additional quoting might be required to
prevent the shell from expanding the variables prior to passing them
to the daemon.

If no explicit
.B --service
has been requested,
.B shellinaboxd
defaults to attaching
.B /bin/login
to the root directory of the web server. This is equivalent to saying
.BR --service=/:LOGIN .
.RE
.TP
\fB-t\fP\ |\ \fB--disable-ssl\fP
By default,
.B shellinaboxd
redirectes all incoming HTTP requests to their equivalent HTTPS
URLs. If promoting of connections to encrypted SSL/TLS sessions is
undesired, this behavior can be disabled.

This option is also useful during testing or for deployment in trusted
intranets, if SSL certificates are unavailable.
.TP
\fB-q\fP\ |\ \fB--quiet\fP
Surpresses all messages to
.BR stderr .
This option is mutually exclusive with
.B --debug
and
.BR --verbose .
.TP
\fB-u\fP\ |\ \fB--user=\fP\fIuid\fP
If started as
.BR root ,
the server drops privileges by changing to
.BR nobody ,
unless the
.I uid
has been overridden by this option.

For more details, refer to the description of the
.B --group
option.
.TP
\fB-v\fP\ |\ \fB--verbose\fP
Enables logging of
.IR Apache -style
log file to
.IR stderr .
This option is mutually exclusive with
.B --debug
and
.BR --quiet .
.TP
\fB--version\fP
Prints the version number of the binary and exits.
.SH CONFIGURATION
There are no configuration files or permanent settings for
.BR shell\%ina\%boxd .
A small number of run-time configuration options are available from a
context menu that becomes available when clicking the right mouse button.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP \w'shellinaboxd\ 'u
.B shellinaboxd -t
Attaches a web-enabled login shell to
.I http://localhost:4200/
with SSL/TLS support disabled. This command must be run as
.B root
or the attempt to launch
.I /bin/login
will fail.
.TP
.B shellinaboxd -t -f beep.wav:/dev/null
Runs all services with the audible-bell permanently disabled.
.TP
.B shellinaboxd -t -s /:AUTH:HOME:/bin/bash
Interactively request the user's name and password prior to launching
a Bourne shell. This command can be run by unprivileged users. But if
doing so, it only allows this particular user to log in.
.TP
.B shellinaboxd -c certificates -g shellinaboxd
If the
.B certificates
directory exists and is writable by the
.B shellinaboxd
group, self-signed SSL certificates will be generated in this
directory. Running this command as
.B root
allows any user on the system to log in at
.BR http://localhost:4200/ .
Sessions will automatically be promoted to SSL/TLS.
.TP
.B shellinaboxd -t -s /:LOGIN -s /who:nobody:nogroup:/:w
In addition to the login shell at
.IR http://localhost:4200 ,
show a list of currently logged in users when accessing
.IR http://localhost:4200/who .
This command must be run as
.B root
in order to be able to change to
.B nobody:nogroup
as requested by the service description.
.TP
.B shellinaboxd -t -s '/:root:root:/:wy60 -c /bin/login'
Instead of the standard
.B ANSI/VT100
terminal, publish a
.B Wyse 60\*(Tm
terminal. Again, this command should be run as
.BR root .
.P
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The daemon returns a non-zero exit code in case of failure. With the
exception of a small number of common error cases that are handled
explicitly, most errors result in printing a
.I \(dqCheck failed\(dq
message. This does not typically indicate a bug in the program but is
instead its normal way of reporting errors.

Common failure conditions are reusing a port that is already in use,
lack of sufficient privileges to run a service, failure to find
SSL/TLS certificates, and failure to write newly generated
certificates to the certification directory.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR chmod (1),
.BR last (1),
.BR login (1),
.BR sh (1),
.BR shells (5),
.BR openssl (1SSL),
.BR w (1),
.BR wy60 (1),
.BR xterm (1).
.SH SECURITY
The daemon uses privilege separation techniques to allow it to drop
privileges early. It is aware of setuid flags and restricts some
operations when launched as a setuid application.

Despite these safety features, a bug could conceivably lead to a
determined attacker gaining elevated privileges. It is therefore
strongly discouraged to set the setuid flag on the binary.

The expected deployment would be from a system
.I rc
script launched by
.BR /sbin/init .
For extra security, the
.B --group
and
.B --user
options should be used to change to a dedicated user.

.SH BUGS
Due to browser limitations, some features might not be available to
users of all browers.
.P
Konqueror does not allow for reliable interception of
.I CTRL
keys. If you press a key together with the
.I CTRL
modifier, it continues performing the browser's predefined behavior for
this particular key combination. In most cases, it also fails to report
the correct key to the terminal emulator. As a work-around, pressing
both the
.I CTRL
and the
.I WINDOWS
key sometimes works.
.P
Some browsers, most notably IE on Windows, disallow interception of
.I ALT
keys and always interpret these keys as menu accelerators. As a
work-around, many UNIX applications allow pressing
.IR ESC ,
instead of
.IR ALT .
.P
When using non-US keyboard layouts, some browser do not allow for
reliably determining shifted
.I ALT
keys. Please report these cases if they turn out to be a problem, as
work-arounds might be possible.
.P
Access to the native clipboard is typically not possible. Instead, an
internal clipboard accessible from the right-button context menu is used
for all but IE.
.P
Some browsers restrict the number of concurrent connections to a
server. This restricts how many AJAX terminals can be opened
simultaneously. If this becomes a problem, users can typically
reconfigure their browsers to raise the limit.
