	* Released version 2.2

	* Fixed a bug that could result in the font getting corrupted.

	* Improved compatibility with more versions of the OpenSSL library.
	Previously, the feature test for TLSEXT did not always work correctly,
	resulting in compilation failures.

	* Improved support for embedding shellinaboxd into existing web
	services. SSL certificates can now be passed in through a file
	handle, and port and pid numbers can be retrieved from the CGI header.

	* Released version 2.1

	* Fixed build errors mostly related to x86_64.

	* Added --no-beep command line option to avoid VLC plugin crashing
	Firefox/x86_64.

	* Fixed multi-line selections in Firefox.

	* Added CGI mode for demand-loading the shellinaboxd daemon
	from a web server. This also allows for the web server to
	perform authentication, instead of having shellinaboxd do so.
	
	* Tightened setuid-root operation to no longer allow switching
	to arbitrary users/groups. As before, setuid-root remains a
	non-standard configuration that is not currently recommended.
	
	* Fixed session management to deal better with torn down
	connections. Closed one bug that could have resulted in
	permanently orphaned connections, when the browser navigated
	away from the page.

2008-12-27  Markus Gutschke  <markus@shellinabox.com>

	* First public release of the version 2.0 rewrite. This is the
	first release of ShellInABox that supports an AJAX interface
	instead of the original Java applet.
