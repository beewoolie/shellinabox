	* Added CGI mode for demand-loading the shellinaboxd daemon
	from a web server. This also allows for the web server to
	perform authentication, instead of having shellinaboxd do so.
	
	* Tightened setuid-root operation to no longer allow switching
	to arbitrary users/groups. As before, setuid-root remains a
	non-standard configuration that is not currently recommended.
	
	* Fixed session management to deal better with torn down
	connections. Closed one bug that could have resulted in
	permanently orphaned connections, when the browser navigated
	away from the page.

	* First public release of the version 2.0 rewrite. This is the
	first release of ShellInABox that supports an AJAX interface
	instead of the original Java applet.
